    <p>At first, the people praised Oryol as a savior. Songs were sung in her honor, and offerings were left by the riverbanks. However, fear soon replaced gratitude. Her serpent form haunted their dreams, and suspicion grew in their hearts. Some began to believe that Oryol herself was a greater threat than the monsters she defeated. Blinded by greed and fear, the village leaders devised a plan to capture her. They lured Oryol with false promises of peace and gratitude, only to trap her with enchanted chains and heavy nets. Betrayed by those she had saved, Oryol cried out in pain and fury. Summoning the last of her strength, Oryol shattered her chains and escaped into the depths of the river. Before disappearing, she left behind a warning that echoed across Ibalong: that humans must learn to respect nature and those who protect it, or face the consequences of their own betrayal.From that day on, Oryol was never seen again. Yet her legend lived on, passed from generation to generation. Elders would tell the story by firelight, reminding the people that true monsters are not always those with fangs and scales—but those with ungrateful and fearful hearts.
