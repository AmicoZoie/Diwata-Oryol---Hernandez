      The beautiful land of Ibalong, with its lush forests, flowing rivers, and blooming flora, seemed peaceful and serene. 
      But hidden beneath its tall trees and dark caves loomed a gem that shone so brightly it was forced into hiding. 
      The name Oryol spread through the towns in whispers and gossip—stories of a woman of striking beauty, with a voice that rivaled a siren’s song. 
      Yet alongside tales of her grace came darker rumors: that her lower body was that of a serpent, making her presence as terrifying as it was captivating. 
      Despite this, Oryol lived quietly near the astonishing Bicol River. She minded her own business and never attacked unless provoked, 
      though she carried a deep distrust toward humans.
