    <p>On the other hand, to the annoyance of the demigoddess, chaos ruled the land. Ferocious beasts roamed freely—giant boars destroyed farmlands, monstrous crocodiles lurked beneath the waters, and savage creatures attacked travelers and villagers alike. Fear spread throughout Ibalong, forcing families to stay indoors and abandon their once peaceful routines. The people lived in constant worry, unable to protect themselves from the growing destruction. Seeing the suffering of the innocent stirred something within Oryol. From afar, she watched children cry from hunger and families grieve over their losses. Though she despised the cruelty of humans, she could not ignore their pain. With reluctant compassion, she left her hidden sanctuary and decided to restore peace to the land. Using her intelligence and unmatched strength, Oryol confronted the beasts one by one. She lured the mighty wild boar into exhaustion and outwitted the massive crocodile by drawing it onto shallow land. One after another, the monsters fell, and the land of Ibalong slowly returned to peace. Villagers cautiously emerged from their homes, amazed by the sudden silence and safety that surrounded them. Crops began to grow once more, and rivers flowed freely without fear. For the first time in many seasons, hope returned to the hearts of the people. They whispered Oryol’s name not in fear, but in gratitude.
