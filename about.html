      <h2>Origins of the Tale</h2>
      <p>The legend of Oryol in the land of Ibalong is rooted in the rich oral traditions of the Bicolano people in the Philippines, forming a central part of the ancient epic known as Ibalong. Originally a formidable antagonist to the hero Handiong, Oryol represents the complex duality of nature—both a dangerous, serpent-like force and a wise, transformative ally who eventually helped civilize the region. Her story serves as a cultural metaphor for the transition from a wild, untamed wilderness to a structured society, highlighting the thin line between monstrous perception and heroic reality. This myth persists today as a powerful reminder of the deep-seated respect and caution the people of Bicol maintain toward the mystical and natural world.</p>

      <h2> Reflection on the Work</h2>
      <p>I, the author, thought of writing about one of my favorite antagonists from my favorite Filipino epic, Ibalong. My grandmother—a true and proud Bicolano—would love to tell me about this epic, and how this was one of her only son's—my father—favorite tales. Now that her death anniversary has just passed, I wanted to give tribute to her culture and a piece of connection between the two of us. By revisiting the legend of Oryol, I feel as though I am breathing life back into the oral traditions she so carefully preserved in my memory. Her voice used to carry the same mystery and strength as the characters in these stories, and writing this piece allows me to honor the heritage she held dear. It is more than just a creative exercise; it is a way to bridge the gap between generations and keep our family’s Bicolano roots thriving. Through these words, her legacy remains as enduring as the myths she passed down to me.</p>
